                <h2 id="">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>

                <h3>Methods of processing</h3>

                <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                    modification,
                    or
                    unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out using computers
                    and/or IT
                    enabled
                    tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In
                    addition to
                    the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
                    involved
                    with the
                    operation of this Website (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
                    external
                    parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT
                    companies,
                    communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list
                    of
                    these
                    parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>

                <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>

                <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations
                        the
                        Owner
                        may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
                        without
                        having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                        apply,
                        whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                        pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
                    <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
                        of
                        official
                        authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by
                        a
                        third
                        party.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                    processing, and
                    in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
                    a
                    requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>

                <h3>Place</h3>

                <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                    involved in the
                    processing are located.<br /><br />
                    Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                    country
                    other
                    than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can
                    check the
                    section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                    European Union
                    or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
                    countries,
                    such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br />
                    If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
                    document or
                    inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

                <h3>Retention time</h3>

                <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                    collected for.</p>
                <p>Therefore:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
                        and
                        the
                        User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
                    <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained
                        as
                        long as
                        needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
                        interests
                        pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                    consent
                    to such
                    processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
                    retain
                    Personal
                    Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
                    upon
                    order of
                    an authority.<br /><br />
                    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
                    the
                    right to
                    erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                    expiration of
                    the retention period.</p>

                <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
                <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                    vested
                    in the
                    Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to
                    such
                    processing
                    by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
                <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing
                    purposes,
                    they can
                    object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the
                    Owner
                    is
                    processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of
                    this
                    document. </p>

                    provided
                    in this
                    document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as
                    early as
                    possible and always within one month.</p>
