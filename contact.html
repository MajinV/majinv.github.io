                I provide a free initial consultation for your event. At this
                meeting your requirements will be discussed in detail to
                establish your personal style choices. If you have ideas for
                colours, a theme or suggestions for the style and look that you
                would like to achieve, this is a great opportunity to explore
                and discuss these.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can have the initial meeting in person, using Skype, or on
                the phone if you prefer. There will be lots of visual aspects to
                explore, so in person is best where possible!

                You will receive an estimate for your wedding decorations within
                one week of the consultation. I will also provide a description
                of elements discussed and to be used within the displays.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prices vary depending on several factors, but this will be
                discussed at the consultation along with your budget. I will
                endeavour to work to your budget and find a way to achieve the
                look you want at a price that suits you.

                Every element made from polymer clay will be an individual work
                of art, hand crafted with love just for you. To compliment the
                exquisite clay elements, only the highest quality of product
                will be used to enhance the decorations for your wedding. My
                designs will reflect everything we’ve discussed in the
                consultation.

              <p>
                Finally, as nothing is perishable the items can be kept or
                gifted as the perfect memento from your special day.

                This can be quite daunting but once you get going you will
                quickly find that you know what you like and, just as
                importantly, what you don’t like.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best thing to do is simply start gathering images of any
                styles, items or arrangements that catch your eye. You don’t
                have to love them – but if they catch your eye, there must be a
                reason why. Pinterest is a great source of inspiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the consultation, we’ll explore all the images you’ve saved
                and discuss each one. We’ll work out what’s important to you,
                establish whether there’s a theme running through your choices
                and start designing something beautiful for you. The images you
                save will be a springboard for the consultation!
              </p>
            </div>

          <div class="container__content-section">

              <h3>What happens in a consultation?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="container__content-text">
              <p>
                Based on your location we can arrange a meeting place, if local
                to the area I can travel to your home for the consultation or we
                can meet somewhere else if you would prefer. The consultation
                can take up to a couple of hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will go through images with you, discussing what you like and
                write notes on your wishes. This allows me to get to know you,
                understand your style, the things you like and just as
                importantly, the things you don’t like. There is no right or
                wrong, it is your wedding and I am simply there to assist you in
                creating a beautiful, visual narrative to your perfect day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be as open as you can be with me as it will help me to truly
                understand you and your requirements as a couple. Don’t be
                afraid to say when you “love” or “dislike” something!
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, it is really useful for you to have a rough idea of
                your budget, this is an important element in ensuring we get the
                brief right for you. By the end of the consultation, we’ll have
                put a design together for you that fits your budget and style.

            <div class="container__content-text">
              <p>
                Following the consultation, I will prepare your estimate and
                send this within 1 week of the consultation (this may take
                slightly longer during peak wedding season, but you will be
                advised if this is the case at the consultation). You may want
                to make some changes which I will amend and resend as
                appropriate.

            <div class="container__content-text">
              <p>
                It is not uncommon for your order to change slightly. However,
                please note that as all the items are handmade especially for
                you, which is a time sensitive process, there will be a cut-off
                point in which changes can no longer be made. This will vary
                from wedding to wedding. Larger scale weddings will need to
                finalize sooner than smaller weddings. This will be advised to
                you at the same time as your initial estimate is sent through,
                so you are fully informed.

            <div class="container__content-text">
              <p>
                There is no one set price and the price will vary from wedding
                to wedding. I work to a variety of budgets and I believe that
                everyone should be able to get the look they want no matter what
                their budget.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your budget is on the smaller side I have many techniques to
                help keep the costs down for you but this will obviously require
                compromise on some elements, such as how many handmade clay
                flowers you have. As every element is created on a bespoke basis
                I will only be able to work out a price for you once I’ve spoken
                to you in depth about your requirements.

                I can’t stress enough that there are no rules! It’s your wedding
                and you should have whatever you want. However if you do need a
                bit of inspiration here is a list of things frequently ordered:

              <ul>
                <li>Table centrepieces</li>

                <li>Wedding Favours</li>
                <li>Ceremony decorations</li>
                <li>Pew ends</li>
                <li>Hair decorations</li>
                <li>
                  Button Holes (usually for the Groom, Best Man, Ushers, Fathers
                  of the couple and any other close male friends or relatives)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Corsages (like feminine button holes) for the mothers of the
                  couple and any other important female friends or relatives
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At the moment I don’t do bouquets however if this is of interest
                to you please do let me know as it is something I could quite
                easily look into for you.

                If your wish is for me to set up the venue for you on your

                (if you are just outside one of the areas please do contact me
                as this is a rough guide only)
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>East London</li>

                Alternatively as the items are non-perishable I can look at
                sending these to most locations within the UK although there
                will be a delivery cost which you will be responsible for and
                you will have to arrange set up on the day.

                Not always, no. If you’re getting married in a venue I know well
                or your requirements are quite straight forward there’s no need.
                If it is a wedding venue I’m not so familiar with, or if you
                require particular or unusual arrangements, I am happy to come
                along and meet you there to visualise your big day and see what
                we can do for you.

                On your wedding day, I will set up a few hours before your
                ceremony. If you have ordered button holes, corsages or hair
                accessories I will likely arrange for these to be delivered to
                you in advance of the day or on the day whichever ends up
                suiting the best. I am happy to liaise with your venue if
                necessary and fit in around times. I can be flexible on this and
                will work around times to suit you. Please note that I am unable
                to do take down of the items.

                I will endeavour to meet my commitments and do everything in my
                power to overcome any problems. My aim is to always set up the
                wedding to make the day as stress free for you as possible.
                However, as the products are non-perishable, should the weather
                forecast indicate a potential problem we can always arrange
                to deliver them to you in advance for you to make your own set
                up arrangements with the venue. Although not ideal, we will have
                ensured your day continues to be a success.
