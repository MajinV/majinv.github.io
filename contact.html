At this meeting your requirements will be discussed in detail to establish your personal style choices. If you have ideas of colours, theme or style that you would like to achieve, this is a great opportunity to explore and discuss these possibilities.</p><p> Where possible I recommend having the initial meeting in person as there are lots of visual aspects to explore however where this is not possible then the consultation can be done via Skype, or on the phone if you prefer.</p></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>Estimate</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> You will receive an estimate for your wedding decorations within one week of the consultation. I will also provide a description of elements discussed and to be used within the displays.</p><p> Prices vary depending on several factors, but this will be discussed at the consultation along with your budget. I will endeavour to work to your budget and find a way to achieve the look you want at a price that suits you.</p></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>Creating your dream wedding!</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> Every element made from polymer clay will be an individual work of art, hand crafted with love just for you. To compliment the exquisite clay elements, only the highest quality of product will be used to enhance the decorations for your wedding. My designs will reflect everything we’ve discussed in the consultation.</p><p> Finally, as nothing is perishable the items can be kept or gifted as the perfect memento from your special day.</p></div></div></div> </section> <section id="faqs-container"><div class="container__content"><div class="container__content-title"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>How do I choose my wedding centrepieces?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> The consultation is designed to help clarify this. If you know what you want, then fantastic. However, most people aren’t quite sure at this point so please don’t feel under any pressure to come knowing exactly what you do want. Simply start gathering images of styles, items or arrangements that appeal to you. Pinterest is a great source of inspiration.</p><p> The images you save will act as a springboard for the consultation, so it is well worth spending the time collating some you like. In the consultation, we will explore all the images you’ve saved and often a theme becomes apparent through this. We will discover what is important to you and then start designing something beautiful for your special day.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>What happens in a consultation?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> Firstly, based on your location we will arrange a meeting place convenient to you. The consultation itself can take up to a couple of hours.</p><p> As mentioned above we will go through the images you have collated to establish what your dream wedding looks like and start working on a design bespoke to you.</p><p> Finally, it is really useful for you to have a rough idea of your budget; this is an important element in ensuring we get the brief right for you. By the end of the consultation, we will have put a design together for you that fits both your budget and style.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>When will we receive an estimate?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> Following the consultation, I will prepare your estimate and send it over within 1 week of the consultation (this may take slightly longer during peak wedding season, but you will be advised if this is the case at the consultation). You may want to make some changes which I will amend and resend as appropriate.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>What if we want to make changes to our order?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> It is not uncommon for your order to change slightly. However, please note that as all the items are handmade especially for you, which is a time sensitive process, there will be a cut-off point from which changes can no longer be made. This will vary from wedding to wedding. Larger scale weddings will need to finalize sooner than smaller weddings. This will be advised to you at the same time as your initial estimate is sent through, so you are fully informed.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>How much do wedding centrepieces and table décor cost?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> I work to a variety of budgets and I will work on designs that are sensitive to both your budget and theme. It is very useful for clients to have a rough idea of what they would like to spend so that I can tailor the designs accordingly.</p><p> Every wedding is different and every element is created on a bespoke basis so I will only be able to work out a price for you once I’ve spoken with you about your specific requirements.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>How and when do we pay to secure the order?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> A deposit is required to book Eternal Posy. This will be due after you have received the estimate and when you have decided you wish to proceed with booking Eternal Posy for your wedding. Until I have received this payment the booking remains unconfirmed. In addition to this payment I will also ask that you sign and complete an Agreement Form to secure your booking. The remaining balance is due 6 weeks prior to the wedding. Payments can be made by online transfer.</p><p> This information will be outlined in our contract that I will provide when you decide to proceed with the booking.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3> What are we ‘supposed’ to have for our wedding decorations?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> This is entirely up to you, it is your wedding and therefore you should have the items that are important to you. However, if you need inspiration here is a list of things frequently ordered:</p><ul><li>Table centrepieces</li><li>Top table display</li><li>Table confetti</li><li>Wedding favours</li><li>Ceremony decorations</li><li>Pew ends</li><li>Hair decorations</li><li> Button holes (usually for the Groom, Best Man, Ushers, Fathers of the couple and any important male friends or relatives)</li><li> Corsages (like feminine button holes) for the mothers of the couple and any other important female friends or relatives</li></ul><p> At the moment I don’t do bouquets however if this is of interest to you please do let me know as it is something I could quite easily look into for you.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>What areas do you venue dress?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> If your wish is for me to set up the venue for you on your wedding day then the venue areas that I cover is as per the below (if you are just outside one of the areas please do contact me as this is a rough guide only):</p><ul><li>East and North London</li><li>Essex (up to Colchester)</li><li>Hertfordshire</li><li>Cambridgeshire</li></ul><p> Alternatively as the items are non-perishable I can look at sending these to most locations within the UK although there will be a delivery cost which you will be responsible for and you will have to arrange set up on the day.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>Do you always visit the wedding venue with every client?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> This depends on your requirements. If your requirements are quite straight forward, then typically I won’t need to. However, if it is a venue I am unfamiliar with or your requirements are more complex then we can most certainly make a visit beforehand.</p><p> Regardless of whether I visit or not, I will always be in direct contact with the venue to plan set up so that this runs smoothly on the day.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3>What happens on our wedding day?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> On your wedding day, I will set up a few hours before your ceremony. If you have ordered button holes, corsages or hair accessories I will likely arrange for these to be delivered to you in advance of the day or on the day whichever ends up suiting the best.</p><p> I am happy to liaise directly with your venue and fit in around times that suit both you and your venue. Please note that I am unable to do take down of the items after the wedding.</p></div><div class="container__content-hrule"></div></div><div class="container__content-section"><div class="container__content-subtitle"><h3> What if you are unable to get to us on the day through unforeseen circumstances?</h3></div><div class="container__content-text"><p> I will endeavour to meet my commitments and do everything in my power to overcome any problems.</p><p> In the unlikely event of serious illness, I will brief and arrange for an alternative person to set up on my behalf, this will not impact upon your wedding day at all however I will of course notify you that I have had to do this.</p><p> If I am unable to get to you because of poor weather conditions, such as snow, then in very rare circumstances this may be unavoidable. However in the months where this is a potential issue I will ensure I check the forecast on the run up to the wedding and as the products are non-perishable, should the weather forecast indicate a significant problem we can always arrange to deliver them to you in advance for you to make your own set up arrangements with the venue. Although not ideal, we will have ensured your day looks as you had planned.</p><p> These are both highly unlikely circumstances however, I feel it is always best to have a backup plan in place to ensure you get your dream wedding.</p></div></div></div> </section> <section id="social-container"><div class="social-container__content"><ul class="social-container__content-column__links"><li class="social-container__content-column__link"> <a href="https://facebook.com/eternalposy" target="_blank" ><img src="images/facebook.svg" /></a></li><li class="social-container__content-column__link"> <a href="https://instagram.com/eternalposy" target="_blank" ><img src="images/instagram.svg" /></a></li><li class="social-container__content-column__link"></li></ul></div> </section> </main> <footer> <section id="footer-container"><div class="main-footer__info"><ul class="main-footer__info-columns"><li class="main-footer__info-column"><div class="main-footer__info-column__title">Site Pages</div><ul class="main-footer__info-column__links"><li class="info-column__link"><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="decorations/index.html">Centrepieces</a></li><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="favours/index.html">Favours</a></li><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="accessories/index.html">Accessories</a></li></ul></li><li class="main-footer__info-column"><div class="main-footer__info-column__title">Social Media</div><ul class="main-footer__info-column__links"><li class="info-column__link"> <img src="images/facebook.svg" /> <a href="https://facebook.com/eternalposy" target="_blank" >Facebook</a ></li><li class="info-column__link"> <img src="images/instagram.svg" /> <a href="https://instagram.com/eternalposy" target="_blank" >Instagram</a ></li><li class="info-column__link"></li><li class="info-column__link"></li></ul></li><li class="main-footer__info-column"><div class="main-footer__info-column__title">About</div><ul class="main-footer__info-column__links"><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="privacy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a></li><li id="changeOptions" class="info-column__link"> Privacy Options</li><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="mailto:joanna@eternalposy.co.uk" >joanna@eternalposy.co.uk</a ></li><li class="info-column__link"> <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/eternalposy" target="_blank" >Etsy Shop</a ></li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="footer__copyright"><div class="footer__copyright-info"> Copyright &copy; 2019 - Eternal Posy</div></div> </section> </footer> <script src="scripts/shared.js"></script> </body></html>
